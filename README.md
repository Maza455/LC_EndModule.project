## E-Commerce Project Structure

This e-commerce project consists of the following main components:

- **About**: Contains information about the e-commerce store.
- **Admin**: Provides access to the administrative dashboard.
- **Books**: Manages the book products available for sale.
- **Cart**: Manages the shopping cart and checkout process.
- **Contact**: Provides contact information for customer support.
- **Home**: The main landing page of the e-commerce store.
- **Index**: Another term for the main landing page.
- **Load**: Manages the loading of content or resources.
- **Products**: Manages the products available for sale.
&&
- **Style.css**: The main stylesheet for custom styles.

The `style.css` file contains the custom styles for the e-commerce store, while other files such as `jQuery`, `FontAwesome`, and `Bootstrap` are included to provide additional functionality and styling. It's important to maintain the separation of concerns and ensure that the main styles are defined in `style.css` to keep the project organized and maintainable.

It was a best practice for me and I quickly understood and made me productive. I hope you enjoyed my E-commerce site TaaaDaa![Alt text](image.png) ⭐⭐⭐
